# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes how user engagement declines over time after acquisition and compares retention patterns across different cohort months and acquisition channels.

The analysis focuses on users acquired between **November 2020 and January 2021**, covering over **800,000 users** and tracking engagement behavior across the first **three weeks** of activity.

A cohort-based framework was used to evaluate early churn, identify high-performing segments, and assess the effectiveness of acquisition channels.

---

# 🎯 Objective

- Measure post-acquisition retention by cohort month
- Compare engagement trends across acquisition channels
- Identify early drop-off patterns
- Evaluate short-term user lifecycle performance
- Generate actionable recommendations for retention improvement

---

## 📊 Data Source

- Google Analytics 4 Public E-commerce Dataset
- Extracted via BigQuery
- Event-level data including:
  - `session_start`
  - `user_engagement`
- Time period: **2020–2021**

Users were assigned to cohorts based on their first recorded engagement event.

---

## 🧮 Methodology

### Cohort Definition
- Cohorts defined by users’ first activity month
- Example: 2020-11, 2020-12, 2021-01
  
---

### Week Assignment
- Week number calculated using date difference from first engagement
- Week 0 = First interaction
- Weeks 1–3 = Subsequent engagement periods

---

### Retention Calculation

Retention was calculated as: Retention Rate = Active Users in Week N / Cohort Size (Week 0)


Values were stored as proportions (0–1) and displayed as percentages.

### Aggregation
- Retention metrics aggregated using averages
- Ensured consistency across cohorts and channels

---

### Data Processing
- SQL (BigQuery) used for data extraction and transformation
- Power Query used for cleaning and validation
- Looker Studio used for visualization

---

## 📈 Visualization Design

Dashboards were built in Looker Studio with the following structure:

- X-axis: Week since acquisition
- Y-axis: Average retention (%)
- Series: Cohort month
- Filters:
  - Cohort Month
  - Acquisition Channel

Key visuals include:
- Retention curve line charts
- Channel comparison charts
- Cohort heatmaps
- Summary KPI cards

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- All cohorts experienced major drop-off between Week 1 and Week 2
- Average retention declined from **3.84% (Week 1)** to **2.03% (Week 3)** in the best-performing cohort
- The January 2021 cohort showed the lowest retention, falling below **0.2% by Week 3**
- Referral and organic channels consistently outperformed paid channels
- High-performing cohorts retained more than **2× the average user base**
- No cohort demonstrated long-term stabilization within the first three weeks

---

## 💼 Business Implications

- The first two weeks represent the most critical engagement window
- Users who disengage early are unlikely to return
- Channel quality has a significant impact on lifecycle value
- Short-term retention is a strong predictor of long-term performance

---

## ✅ Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:

### 1. Optimize Early Onboarding
Focus on improving user activation within the first 7–14 days through:
- Guided onboarding flows
- Personalized welcome campaigns
- Early feature education

### 2. Prioritize High-Performing Channels
Increase investment in referral and organic acquisition channels, which demonstrated stronger retention performance.

### 3. Improve Paid Channel Quality
Re-evaluate paid acquisition strategies to:
- Reduce low-quality traffic
- Improve targeting
- Align messaging with user intent

### 4. Implement Early Engagement Triggers
Deploy automated interventions when users show signs of early disengagement, such as:
- Reminder emails
- In-app prompts
- Targeted content recommendations

### 5. Monitor Cohort Performance Continuously
Establish regular cohort reporting to detect early changes in engagement patterns and adjust strategies proactively.
